[list=1]
[*] Download the latest release (from nexus or [url=https://github.com/terry-haire/fnv-to-fo4/releases]GitHub[/url]) and unzip it.
[*] Install Fallout: New Vegas and launch it at least once.
[*] Install Fallout 4 and launch it at least once.

[*] Allow mods in Fallout 4 ([url=https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Fallout_4_Mod_Installation]source[/url]).
